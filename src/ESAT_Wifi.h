// Wifi board module.
// The Wifi board goes into a socket in the OBC board and has the
// following responsibilities:
// - Connect through the wireless interface to a ground segment
//   server.
// - Connect trhough the serial interface to the OBC.
// - Receive telecommand packets from the ground segment server and
//   forward them to the OBC.
// - Receive telecommand packets from the OBC and execute them.
// - Receive telemetry packets from the OBC and forward them to the
//   ground segment server.
// The telecommands handled by the Wifi board are for simple network
// connection configuration actions.
// Use the global ESAT_Wifi object to access the functionality of
// the Wifi board.  See the example program.
